# Enhancing Body Detection in Collapsed Structures | Smart India Hackathon 2024  

### Overview  
This project was developed for **Smart India Hackathon 2024** under the **Disaster Management** theme. Our goal was to revolutionize **body detection in collapsed structures** using AI-driven 3D mapping, electromagnetic waves, and drones.  

### Problem Statement  
In disaster scenarios, locating victims quickly is critical. Traditional methods like manual searches are slow, less accurate, and risky. Our solution addresses these challenges through innovative technologies.  

### Solution Highlights  
- **3D Mapping with Multi-Frequency EM Waves**: Generates detailed depth maps of debris.  
- **AI-Driven Precision**: Enhances accuracy with real-time image processing.  
- **Drone-Assisted Scanning**: Reduces human exposure to hazardous zones.  

### Features  
- **300% Faster Detection**: Accelerates rescue operations significantly.  
- **500% Improved Success Rates**: Increases the probability of locating victims.  
- **70% Risk Reduction**: Minimizes rescuer exposure to danger.  

### Technology Stack  
- **Radar Technology**: Ultra-Wideband (UWB) for depth data acquisition.  
- **AI & Python**: Real-time image enhancement and resolution optimization.  
- **MATLAB**: Data integration for initial 3D reconstruction.  
- **Drone Integration**: Raspberry Pi-powered drones for scalable deployment.  

### Challenges Faced  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: The use of UWB requires licensing for specific frequency bands, which was an oversight in our feasibility analysis.  

### Next Steps  
We aim to refine this solution by exploring alternative, compliant technologies and collaborating with experts to make it scalable and impactful.
